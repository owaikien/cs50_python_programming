# cs50_python_programming

I finished the [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) but didn't opt for a professional certificate as you would have to pay for it, so I created this repository to store all my answers for the exercises.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn Python. It was an amazing course!

The content covered:
1. Functions, Variables
2. Conditionals
3. Loops
4. Exceptions
5. Libraries

8. Regular Expressions
