# cs50_python_programming

I finished the [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) but didn't opt for a professional certificate as you would have to pay for it, so I created this repository to store all my answers for the exercises in the course.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn Python. It was an amazing course!

The content covered:
1. Functions, Variables
2. Conditionals
3. Loops
4. Exceptions
